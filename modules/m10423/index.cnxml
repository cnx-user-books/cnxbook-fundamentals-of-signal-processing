	  There exist many applications in modern signal processing
	  where it is advantageous to separate a signal into different
	  frequency ranges called <term>sub-bands</term>.  The
	  spectrum might be partitioned in the uniform manner
	  illustrated in <link target-id="fig1" strength="3"/>, where the
	  sub-band width

	  Alternatively, the sub-bands might have a logarithmic
	  spacing like that shown in <link target-id="fig2" strength="3"/>.

	  For most of our discussion, we will focus on uniformly
	  spaced sub-bands.

	  The separation into sub-band components is intended to make
	  further processing more convenient.  Some of the most
	  popular applications for sub-band decomposition are audio
	  and video source coding (with the goal of efficient storage
	  and/or transmission).
	</para>

	<para id="p3_s1s1">
	  <link target-id="fig3" strength="3"/> illustrates the use of
	  sub-band processing in MPEG audio coding.  There a
	  psychoacoustic model is used to decide how much quantization
	  error can be tolerated in each sub-band while remaining
	  below the hearing threshold of a human listener.  In the
	  sub-bands that can tolerate more error, less bits are used
	  for coding.  The quantized sub-band signals can then be
	  decoded and recombined to reconstruct (an approximate
	  version of) the input signal.  Such processing allows, on
	  average, a 12-to-1 reduction in bit rate while still
	  maintaining "CD quality" audio.  The psychoacoustic model
	  takes into account the <term>spectral masking</term>
	  phenomenon of the human ear, which says that high energy in
	  one spectral region will limit the ear's ability to hear
	  details in nearby spectral regions.  Therefore, when the
	  energy in one sub-band is high, nearby sub-bands can be
	  coded with less bits without degrading the perceived quality
	  of the audio signal.  The MPEG standard specifies
	  32-channels of sub-band filtering.  Some psychoacoustic
	  models also take into account "temporal masking" properties
	  of the human ear, which say that a loud burst of sound will
	  temporarily overload the ear for short time durations,
	  making it possible to hide quantization noise in the time
	  interval after a loud sound burst.

	  In typical applications, non-trivial signal processing takes
	  place between the bank of analysis filters and the bank of
	  synthesis filters, as shown in <link target-id="fig4" strength="3"/>.  We will focus, however, on filterbank
	  design rather than on the processing that occurs between the
	  filterbanks.

	  Our goals in filter design are:

	      Good sub-band frequency separation
	      (<foreign>i.e.</foreign>, good "frequency selectivity").

	    </item>
	  </list>
	</para>		      
	
	<para id="p6_s1s1">
	  The first goal is driven by the assumption that the sub-band
	  processing works <emphasis>best</emphasis> when it is given
	  access to cleanly separated sub-band signals, while the
	  second goal is motivated by the idea that the sub-band
	  filtering should not limit the reconstruction performance
	  when the sub-band processing (<foreign>e.g.</foreign>, the
	  coding/decoding) is lossless or nearly lossless.
